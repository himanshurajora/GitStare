# Git Stare ðŸ¥¸

#### As always this project was also inspired by A personal problem I faced.

### Problem
The Problem is that when I wanted to look at other people's github activity, I had to open and load the whole page just to see the activity in the activity graph. So I decided to make a small web app 

### Solution
I made a small web app that will only load the recent activity of the user.

### Features
- Load the activity of the user
- username can be specified in the url, format : ``` https://gitstare.web.app/username ```

### New 
- Identical color schemas for different types of activity
- Direct Access to commit changes links

### Future Scope
- Activity Graph Support
- Other Amazing Features (Like: Search, Filter, etc)
